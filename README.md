DistList - Simplified management of email communications

Distlist is a system for manage complex email.  Every address has many keys, usefull for replacement during the mail sending.

With "rake:seed" the system save a user "admin@distlist.com" with password "12345678", with this users is possible generate a new use with a sensate password.

Before use Distlist you must configure the mail server for sending mail. An example is present in development.rb

At this moment the graphics is strictly css3/html5 and not work correctly with iexplorer. In the next release I will work for  a more compatible template.

To do:
Send mail for user with specific keys
Unsubscribe list (if is expected)
