DistList - Simplified management of email communications

Distlist is a system for manage complex email.  Every address has many keys, usefull for replacement during the mail sending.

With "rake db:seed" the system save a user "admin@distlist.com" with password "12345678", with this users is possible generate a 
new use with a sensate password.

Before Distlist's use you must configure the system for sending mail. An example is present in development.rb

At this moment the graphics is strictly css3/html5 and not work correctly with iexplorer. In the next release I will work for  a more compatible template.

### To do:

* Send mail only for user with specific keys
* More report
* More pretty and compatible template
* Add a WYSIWYG Editor
* Do not allow simultaneous deliveries of same email
* Do not allow modify or delete an email when send thread is active
